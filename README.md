# React Native Mini Game

## Description

This is a mini guessing game built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/). The game is simple, you have to input a number between 1 and 100 and the app will try to guess it. You can tell the app if the number is higher or lower than the guess and the app will adjust its guess accordingly.

> Note: The app is still in development...

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the app
4. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone or run the app on an emulator
5. Run `i` to open the app on an iOS simulator or `a` to open the app on an Android emulator
6. Run `r` to restart the app
7. Enjoy the game!

> Tip: If you prefer, you could also directly run the simulator by running `npm run ios` or `npm run android` instead of running `npm start`
